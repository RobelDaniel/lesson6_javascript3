### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (I forgot what the purpose of the "src tag" was and because of this assignment I remembered that the purpose was to source it to where the image is. If the src tag is not present then the picture wont load. )
2. (The left and right arrow functions are used to move the photos in either direction when you click on the left or right arrow. Without these, the photos wouldn't move.)
3. (The previewFive function was the important centerpiece of this assignment. It stretched out the layout from displaying 3 photos to 5.)
